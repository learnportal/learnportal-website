                To solve this, we need to identify the type of growth depicted by the problem. Since the population increases by a percentage each year, this is an example of exponential growth. The formula for exponential growth is \( P(t) = P_0 \cdot (1 + r)^{t} \), where:
            <ul>
                <li>\( P_0 \) is the initial amount, here it is \(10,000\).</li>
                <li>\( r \) is the growth rate, which is \(5\%\) or \(0.05\).</li>
                <li>\( t \) is the number of years since the start time, which is \( t - 2000 \) because we start counting from the year \(2000\).</li>
            </ul>
            Therefore, we plug these values into our formula to get \( P = 10,000 \cdot (1.05)^{t-2000} \).
            <br>
            Choice A is correct as it aligns with the exponential growth formula with the correct base and exponent reflecting the start year of \(2000\).
            <br>
            Choice B is incorrect because it uses \(0.05\) as the base of the exponent, which does not represent a \(5\%\) growth from a base population.
            <br>
            Choice C is incorrect because it represents a linear relationship, which is not suitable for percentage growth per year.
            <br>
            Choice D is incorrect because it uses \( t \) as the base and \(1.05\) as the exponent, which does not conform to the exponential growth model.

                Exponential growth is described by the formula \( P(t) = P_0 \cdot (1 + r)^{t-t_0} \), where \( P_0 \) is the initial population, \( r \) is the growth rate, and \( t_0 \) is the initial time period.
                <br>
                In this scenario:
                <ul>

                Choice C is incorrect because it implies linear growth, not exponential.

                Linear growth means the population increases by a constant amount each period, as opposed to exponential growth, which is a percentage increase based on the current population. 
                <br>
                Choice A and Choice B represent exponential growth because the increase is a percentage of the current population, which means the actual increase amount changes as the population grows.
                <br>
                Choice C represents linear growth because the same number of people, \(20,000\), are added each year, regardless of the current population size.
                <br>
                Choice D represents exponential growth because the population is doubling, which is a percentage increase, not a constant amount.

                Since the algae mass doubles every \(5\) days, this is an exponential growth situation. The base of the exponent will be \(2\) because the mass doubles. The exponent \( \frac{t}{5} \) represents the number of \(5-\)day periods in \( t \) days.

                In this scenario, the number of cells increases by a factor of four each day, which is exponential growth. The initial amount of cells is \(100\), and this amount is quadrupled each day, so the equation that models this growth is \( C = 100 \cdot 4^d \).
                <br>

                Choice B is the correct answer. In a situation where a car dealership sells a constant number of cars, \(5\) in this case, from its inventory each week, the total number of cars decreases by the same amount each week. This constant rate of change over time is the defining characteristic of linear behavior. Since the number of cars is going down, it is specifically linear decay.
                <br>
                Choice A describes an increase, which is not happening here as the inventory is depleting by a fixed number each week, not growing.
                <br>
                Choice C is incorrect because exponential growth would mean the number of cars sold each week would be increasing at a rate proportional to the current inventory, which is not described in the scenario.
                <br>
                Choice D also does not fit the scenario, despite the term 'decay' suggesting a decrease. Exponential decay would mean the number of cars sold is proportional to the remaining inventory, which would result in a different number of cars being sold each week as the inventory dwindles, not a constant \(5\) cars.
                <br>
                Therefore, the relationship between time and the number of cars in the inventory in this scenario is best described by decreasing linear growth.

                Choice D is correct. The computer's value decreases by a factor of \(1/2\) each year due to depreciation. This means each year, the computer's value is \(50\%\) of the value of the previous year, which is characteristic of exponential decay. The rate of decrease is not constant in terms of dollars lost per year, but rather is proportional to the computer's value at the beginning of each year.

                Choice C is correct because radioactive decay is an exponential process. Each month, the mass decays by \(2\%\), which means it retains \(98\%\) of its mass from the previous month.

                Choice D is incorrect as it introduces a quadratic term, suggesting the rate of increase in profit changes each year, which is not consistent with the steady increase described.

                Choice C is correct. The coffee shop adds \(2\) more tables each month, which would total \(24\) tables in a year \((2\ \text{tables}/\text{month} × 12\ \text{months}/\text{year})\). This represents a linear growth pattern since the same number of tables is added each month, regardless of how many tables are already in the shop.
                <br>
                Choice A is incorrect because it implies a growth rate that is proportional to the current number of tables each month, which would be an exponential growth pattern, not a fixed number of tables added.
                <br>
                Choice B is incorrect because doubling the number of tables each year is an exponential growth pattern, whereas the scenario describes a constant increase per month.
                <br>
                Choice D is incorrect as it suggests the growth rate is \(5\%\) of the total number of tables at the end of each year, which would again be an exponential growth pattern. The scenario describes a fixed addition each month, which is a linear growth pattern.

                Choice B is correct. Radioactive decay is typically an exponential process. A decay rate of \(2\%\) per day means that \(98\%\) of the substance remains each day. The remaining mass after \( d \) days can be modeled by \( M = 200 \cdot (0.98)^d \), where \( 0.98 \) is the decay factor representing the \(98\%\) that remains each day.
                <br>
                Choice A is incorrect because it suggests that only \(2\%\) of the initial mass remains each day, which would be a much faster decay rate than described.
                <br>
                Choice C is correct mathematically, as \( 1 - 0.02 \) equals \( 0.98 \), but it is a less common way to present the decay factor in exponential decay problems.
                <br>
                Choice D is incorrect because the negative exponent would imply growth, not decay, and it would not represent the process on a daily basis.

                Choice A is correct. The lily pad population is experiencing exponential growth by tripling each week. This is represented mathematically by an initial value (\(5\) lily pads) multiplied by \(3\) raised to the power of the number of weeks, \( w \). Therefore, the model for the population after \( w \) weeks is \( L = 5 \cdot 3^w \).

                Choice B is correct. The town's population is increasing by a fixed amount of people each year, which is characteristic of linear growth. In linear growth, the amount of change over each time period (in this case, one year) is constant. This is represented by a straight line with a positive slope when plotted on a graph.

                Choice C is correct. The owner adds \($100\) to the account every month, resulting in an increase of \($1200\) each year \(($100\ / \text{month} \times 12\ \text{months} / \text{year})\). This is a linear growth since the balance grows by a fixed amount each period.
                <br>
                Choice A is incorrect because a \(2\%\) monthly increase would result in a different amount being added each month, depending on the previous balance, indicating exponential growth.
                <br>
                Choice B is incorrect as it suggests the account balance is doubling each year, which is an exponential growth pattern, not a fixed increase.

                <br>
                Choice C is incorrect because exponential growth would mean that the amount of interest earned is based on a percentage of the account balance, increasing at a rate proportional to the current amount each year, which is not described here.

                Choice A is correct. The luminosity of the bulb decreases exponentially because each year it retains \(90\%(100\% - 10\%)\) loss of its luminosity from the previous year. <br> 
                Thus, the function \( L = 800 \cdot (0.9)^y \) accurately models this decay.
                <br>
                Choice B is incorrect because it would imply the luminosity increases tenfold each year, which is not consistent with a loss of brightness.
                <br>
                Choice C is incorrect as it suggests a linear decline in luminosity, which does not account for the compound effect of the \(10\%\) loss each year.

                Choice D is correct. The yeast culture's mass increases exponentially because each hour it grows by \(10\%\) of the mass it had at the end of the previous hour. This type of growth is modeled by the function \( M = 50 \cdot (1.1)^h \), where \( h \) is the number of hours.

                Choice A is correct. The student learns a constant number of new words each week, which is a characteristic of linear growth. Therefore, the total number of words learned as time progresses increases at a constant rate, which can be graphed as a straight line with a positive slope, hence the term 'increasing linear'.

                Choice C and D are incorrect because they both imply a rate of increase or decrease that is proportional to the number of words already learned, which would be characteristic of exponential change.

                However, because there is a pause every third second, the actual pattern would be a modified exponential growth that includes a steady sequence of pauses.

                Choice C is correct. The population decreases by \(12\%\) every \(6\) months, which means it retains \(88\%\) of its population every \(6\) months. This type of decline is exponential decay because the population decrease is proportional to its current size. The equation \( P = 5,000(0.88)^{m/6} \) models the exponential decay, where \( m \) is the number of months since overfishing began and the exponent \( m/6 \) accounts for the biannual rate of decline.
                <br>
                Choice A is incorrect because \(0.12\) represents a \(12\%\) value, not the remaining \(88\%\) of the population after each \(6-\)month period.
                <br>
                Choice B is incorrect as it suggests a linear decrease of \(600\) fish per month, which does not take into account the compound effect of the percentage decrease.
                <br>
                Choice D is incorrect because the exponent should be \( m/6 \) to reflect the \(6-\)month periods, not \( m \) which would imply a monthly rate.

                Choice A is correct. The production increase by a fixed amount each year indicates a linear growth model. The equation \( P = 500t + 10000 \) reflects this linear relationship, where \( t \) is the number of years since the initial measurement, and \(10,000\) units is the production amount at the start.
                <br>
                Choice B is incorrect because it suggests an exponential growth model with a \(5\%\) increase each year, which does not match the fixed increase of \(500\) units.

                Choice C is correct. The machinery depreciates by \(25\%\) or retains \(75\%\) of its value every \(4\) years. Therefore, the value after \( t \) years is given by the formula \( V = 20,000(0.75)^{t/4} \), where \( t \) is the number of years since \(2010\). The exponent \( t/4 \) is used to account for the depreciation occurring every \(4\) years.
                <br>
                Choice A is incorrect because \( 0.25 \) would represent a \(75\%\) loss, not the \(25\%\) loss specified.
                <br>
                Choice B is incorrect as it suggests a linear decrease, which does not reflect the percentage-based depreciation.
                <br>
                Choice D is incorrect because it applies the depreciation rate as if it occurred annually rather than every four years.

                Choice B is correct. The fish population increases by a constant number of \(40\) fish each year, which represents a linear relationship between time and population. The equation \( F = 40t + 200 \) accurately models this, with \( t \) being the number of years, and \(200\) representing the initial fish population.
                <br>
                Choice A is incorrect because it represents exponential growth, which would not reflect the constant increase of \(40\) fish per year.
                <br>
                Choice C is incorrect as it would imply that the aquarium started with no fish, which is contrary to the given information.
                <br>
                Choice D is incorrect because it includes a quadratic term, which would suggest the rate of increase in population changes over time, not a constant increase.

                Choice C is correct. The statement describes a scenario where the charity's fund increases by a fixed amount each year, which is a characteristic of linear growth. Thus, the charity's fund is not doubling nor growing by a percentage of the total, but rather by a consistent, flat amount annually.
                <br>
                Choice A is incorrect because doubling the fund would indicate an exponential increase, not a flat rate.
                <br>
                Choice B is also incorrect because a \(10\%\) growth rate would imply exponential growth based on the current total, which differs from the scenario described.
                <br>
                Choice D is incorrect because it suggests a smaller percentage growth, which still constitutes exponential growth, not a linear one.

                Choice A is correct. The coffee shop's purchasing pattern is consistent, buying \(5\) cups each day, which indicates a linear relationship. The total number of cups purchased increases by the same amount every day, making the growth linear.
                <br>

                Choice D is correct. The YouTuber's followers are doubling each day, which is characteristic of exponential growth.

                Choice A is incorrect because an increasing linear pattern would suggest the YouTuber gains a constant number of followers every day.

                Choice C is incorrect because it suggests the number of followers is decreasing in a manner proportional to its current total, which is not the case here.
