                To determine the value of \( f(5) \), we can use the given property of the function \( f(x + 1) - f(x) = 3 \) to find the value of \( f(3) \), \( f(4) \), and then \( f(5) \). Since \( f(2) = 10 \), applying the property:
                <ul>
                    <li>\( f(3) = f(2 + 1) = f(2) + 3 = 10 + 3 = 13 \)</li>
                    <li>\( f(4) = f(3 + 1) = f(3) + 3 = 13 + 3 = 16 \)</li>

                Options B, C, and D are incorrect because they do not reflect the consistent application of the function's property for each integer step from \(2\) to \(5\).

                For the system to have no solution, the equations must be parallel, which means their slopes must be the same, but the \(y-\)intercepts must be different. We can rewrite the first equation in slope-intercept form \((y = mx + b)\) as follows:
                \[ 4x - 9y = 9y + 5 \]
                \[ -18y = -4x + 5 \]
                \[ y = \frac{4}{18}x - \frac{5}{18} \]
                The slope of the first equation is \( \frac{2}{9} \).
                For the second equation:
                \[ py = 2 + 4x \]
                \[ y = \frac{4}{p}x + \frac{2}{p} \]
                For the system to have no solution, the slope of the second equation must also be \( \frac{2}{9} \).
                \[ \frac{4}{p} = \frac{2}{9} \]
                Solving for \( p \) gives \( p = 18 \).

                The slope of line \( m \) is given as \( \frac{1}{2} \). A line perpendicular to line \( m \) would have a slope that is the negative reciprocal of \( \frac{1}{2} \), which is \( -2 \). Line \( n \) must pass through the \(y-\)intercept of line \( m \). Since line \( m \) passes through the point \((2, -3)\) with a slope of \( \frac{1}{2} \), we can use the point-slope form to find its \(y-\)intercept (\( b \)):
                \[ -3 = \frac{1}{2}(2) + b \]
                \[ b = -3 - 1 \]
                \[ b = -4 \]
                The \(y-\)intercept of line \( m \) is \(-4\), which is also the \(y-\)intercept of line \( n \) since line \( n \) passes through this point. The equation of line \( n \) is therefore \( y = -2x + b \). <br>
                Options B is incorrect as it represent lines with slopes of \( -2 \) but do not consider the negative value of \( b \) for the \(y-\)intercept. <br>
                Option C is incorrect because it suggests a positive slope, which is not perpendicular to line \( m \). <br>
                Option D incorrectly implies a positive slope and subtracts the \(y-\)intercept, which does not correspond to the slope of a line perpendicular to line \( m \).

                Let the original number be \( 10a + b \) where \( a \) and \( b \) are the tens and units digit respectively. The conditions given are:
                <ul>
                    <li>\( a + b = 12 \) (since the sum of the digits is \(12\))</li>
                    <li>\( 10b + a = 10a + b - 18 \) (since reversing the digits makes the number \(18\) less)</li>
                </ul>
                Simplifying the second equation gives us:
                \[ 9b - 9a = -18 \]
                \[ b - a = -2 \]
                Adding this to the first equation \( a + b = 12 \), we get:
                \[ 2b = 10 \]
                \[ b = 5 \]
                Substituting back into \( a + b = 12 \):
                \[ a + 5 = 12 \]
                \[ a = 7 \]
                Therefore, the original number is \( 10a + b = 70 + 5 = 75 \), which is not listed in the options. There seems to be a mistake either in the question or the options provided.
                If we check the given options: <br>
                <strong>For choice A \((39)\):</strong> The sum is \( 3 + 9 = 12 \), and reversing the digits gives \(93,\) which is \( 93 - 39 = 54 \), not \(18\) less.
                <br>
                <strong>For choice B \((48)\):</strong> The sum is \( 4 + 8 = 12 \), and reversing the digits gives \(84,\) which is \( 84 - 48 = 36 \), not \(18\) less.
                <br>
                <strong>For choice C \((57)\):</strong> The sum is \( 5 + 7 = 12 \), and reversing the digits gives \(75,\) which is \( 75 - 57 = 18 \), less than the original number. <br> 
                Hence, C is the correct answer based on the provided options.
                <br>
                <strong>For choice D \((93)\):</strong> The sum is \( 9 + 3 = 12 \), but reversing the digits gives \(39,\) which is \( 39 - 93 = -54 \), not \(18\) less.

                Choice A is correct. Dividing both sides of the second equation in the given system by \(3\) yields \( 8x + 7y = 9 \),

                Therefore, the first and second equations represent the same line in the \(xy-\)plane. <br>
                If the \(x-\) and \(y-\)coordinates of a point satisfy an equation, the point lies on the graph of the equation in the \(xy-\)plane. <br>
                Choice A is a point with \(x-\)coordinate \( r \) and \(y-\)coordinate \( -\frac{8}{7}r + \frac{9}{7} \). <br>
                Substituting \( r \) for \( x \) and \( -\frac{8}{7}r + \frac{9}{7} \) for \( y \) in the equation \( 8x + 7y = 9 \) 
                yields \( 8r + 7\left(-\frac{8}{7}r + \frac{9}{7}\right) = 9 \). <br>
                Applying the distributive property to the left-hand side of this equation yields \( 8r - 8r + 9 = 9 \). <br>
                Combining like terms on the left-hand side of this equation yields \( 9 = 9 \), so the coordinates of the point 
                \( \left(r, -\frac{8}{7}r + \frac{9}{7}\right) \) satisfy both equations in the given system. <br>
                Therefore, for each real number \( r \), the point \( \left(r, -\frac{8}{7}r + \frac{9}{7}\right) \) lies on the graph of

                Choices B, C, and D are incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Specifically, they do not satisfy the conditions set by the equations in the system when substituted into either equation.

                Choice A is incorrect because \( 3.5(p + 2) \) would imply that the customer is buying \(2\) more pounds of fruit in addition to the bag, which is not stated in the problem.<br>
                Choice C is incorrect as it suggests that the price per pound of fruit is \($5.50\), which is not the case according to the information given.<br>
                Choice D is incorrect because it indicates that the bag's cost is being subtracted from the total cost of the fruit, which contradicts the information provided.<br>
                Therefore, the equation that correctly represents \( C \) as a function of \( p \) is \( C = 3.5p + 2 \), corresponding to choice B.

                To find the slope of line \( r \), which is perpendicular to line \( p \), we first need to find the slope of line \( p \). <br>
                The equation \( 4y + 8x = 6 \) can be rearranged to slope-intercept form \( y = mx + b \), which gives us 
                \( y = -2x + \frac{3}{2} \). <br>
                Therefore, the slope \( m \) of line \( p \) is \( -2 \). <br>
                The slope of a line perpendicular to another line is the negative reciprocal of the original line's slope. <br>

                To find the \(x-\)coordinate of the \(x-\)intercept after the graph is translated down, we first need to adjust the equation of the graph to reflect the translation. Translating a graph down by \(4\) units will subtract \(4\) from the \(y-\)coordinate, which means the new equation will be \( 9x - 10(y + 4) = 19 \) since \( y \) is replaced with \( y + 4 \) for a downward shift.<br>
                Simplifying the new equation gives us \( 9x - 10y - 40 = 19 \), which further simplifies to \( 9x - 10y = 59 \).<br>
                The \(x-\)intercept occurs where \( y = 0 \), so setting \( y \) to \(0\) gives us \( 9x = 59 \), and solving for \( x \) gives \( x = \frac{59}{9} \) which is choice C.

                Choice C is correct. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by \( P = 2(\text{length}) + 2(\text{width}) \). <br>
                For the given lengths, the equation becomes:
                \[ P = 2(3x + 2) + 2(2x - 1) \]
                \[ 70 = 2(3x + 2) + 2(2x - 1) \]
                Expanding this, we get:
                \[ 70 = 6x + 4 + 4x - 2 \]
                \[ 70 = 10x + 2 \]
                Subtracting \(2\) from both sides, we get:
                \[ 68 = 10x \]
                Dividing by \(10\) gives us:
                \[ x = 6.8 \]

                Choice D is correct. The graph shows \( y = f(x) + 14 \), meaning the graph of \( f(x) \) has been shifted up by \(14\) units. <br> 
                To find \( f(x) \), we need to subtract \(14\) from the \( y- \)values of the given graph. <br>
                The \( y- \)intercept of the given graph is at \( y = 0 \), so the \( y- \)intercept of \( f(x) \) will be \( 0 - 14 = -14 \). <br> 
                However, since the graph has been translated up by \(14\) units, we are looking for the equation where, when \( y \) is decreased by \(14\) units,

                The other choices do not result in the correct \( y- \)intercept when translated down by \(14\) units.

                To find the \( x \)-intercept of line \( k \), we first need to determine the slope of line \( h \) using the given table of values. 
                Once we have the slope, we can use the fact that line \( k \) is a translation of line \( h \) down \(5\) units to adjust the \( y- \)intercept accordingly. <br>
                To find the slope, we can use any two points from the table, for example, \((18, 130)\) and \((23, 160)\):
                \[ \text{Slope} = \frac{160 - 130}{23 - 18} = \frac{30}{5} = 6 \]
                The equation of line \( h \) can be written in the slope-intercept form \( y = mx + b \). Using the point \((18, 130)\), we can solve for \( b \):
                \[ 130 = 6(18) + b \]
                \[ b = 130 - 108 = 22 \]
                Therefore, the equation of line \( h \) is \( y = 6x + 22 \). <br>
                Translating line \( h \) down by \(5\) units gives us line \( k \) with the equation \( y = 6x + 17 \). <br>
                Setting \( y = 0 \) to find the \( x \)-intercept of line \( k \) gives:
                \[ 0 = 6x + 17 \]
                \[ 6x = -17 \]
                \[ x = -\frac{17}{6} \]
                Thus, the \( x- \)intercept of line \( k \) is \( \left(-\frac{17}{6}, 0\right) \), which corresponds to choice D.

                Divide both sides of the equation by \(15\) to simplify:
                \[ 2(45x - 27) = -3(18 - 30x) \]
                Expand both sides:
                \[ 90x - 54 = -54 + 90x \]
                When we simplify both sides, we notice that the \( x \) terms are identical and the constant terms cancel each other out, resulting in an identity \( 0 = 0 \). This means that for every value of \( x \), the equation holds true.
                <br>

                \[ 6.50r + 8b = 66 \]
                Multiplying the first equation by \(2\), we get:
                \[ 11r + 6b = 74 \]
                Subtracting the second equation from this result eliminates \( r \):
                \[ (11r + 6b) - (6.50r + 8b) = 74 - 66 \]
                \[ 4.50r - 2b = 8 \]
                \[ 2b = 4.50r - 8 \]
                Simplifying further, we find that for every \( \$1.00 \) increase in the cost of raspberries between the stores, there is a \( \$5.00 \) difference in the cost of blackberries, which corresponds to a difference of \( 5 \) pints. Therefore, the purchaser buys \( 5 \) pints of blackberries.
                <br>
                This corresponds to choice B, indicating that there are \(5\) pints of blackberries in the purchase.

                Given the equation \( 3x - 2y = 12 \) and the point \( (p, q) \) on this line, where \( p = 2q \), we can substitute \( p \) for \( x \) and \( q \) for \( y \) to find the value of \( p \):

                The player's final score is composed of the points earned from completing levels minus the points lost for using hints. For \(10\) levels completed, the player earns \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \) points. Let \( h \) represent the number of hints used. Each hint used subtracts \(2\) points, so the points lost from using hints is \( 2h \). The final score is given by the equation:
                \[ 50 - 2h = 40 \]
                Solving for \( h \) gives us:

                To find the value of \( b \), we need to use the two given points to determine the slope of the line. The slope \( m \) is calculated by the change in \( y \) over the change in \( x \):
                \[ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{-15 - 13}{k + 7 - k} = \frac{-28}{7} = -4 \]
                Now, we know that the \(y-\)intercept occurs when \( x = 0 \). We can use the point-slope form of the equation with either of the two points and the slope to find \( b \). Let's use the point \( (k, 13) \):
                \[ y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \]
                \[ y - 13 = -4(x - k) \]
                When \( x = 0 \), \( y = b \), so:
                \[ b - 13 = -4(0 - k) \]
                \[ b - 13 = 4k \]
                To find \( b \), we need the value of \( k \). Since the \(y-\)intercept is \( (k - 5, b) \), setting \( x = k - 5 \) in the equation gives us:
                \[ b - 13 = -4((k - 5) - k) \]
                \[ b - 13 = -4(-5) \]
                \[ b - 13 = 20 \]
                \[ b = 33 \]
                Thus, the value of \( b \) is \(33\).

                To find the maximum number of hours \( n \) the group can rent the hall, we need to solve for \( n \) when the cost \( C \) is at most \($600\):
                \[ 75n + 150 \leq 600 \]
                Subtracting \(150\) from both sides gives us:
                \[ 75n \leq 450 \]
                Dividing by \(75\) gives us:
                \[ n \leq 6 \]
                Therefore, the maximum number of hours the group can rent the hall is \(6\) hours, which corresponds to choice B.

                The original \(y-\)intercept of line \(m\) can be found from the table where \(x=0\). Since we are given the pay for \(5, 10,\) and \(15\) hours, we can determine the rate of pay per hour and then extrapolate the pay for \(0\) hours. The rate per hour is constant, which we can find by dividing the total pay by the hours worked:
                \[ \text{Rate per hour} = \frac{75}{5} = 15 \text{ dollars per hour} \]
                The \(y-\)intercept of line \(m\) would be the pay for \(0\) hours, which is \(0\) dollars. When line \(m\) is translated up by \(25\) dollars in the \(y-\)direction to create line \(n\), the new \(y-\)intercept will be \(25\) dollars higher than the original line \(m\). Therefore, the \(y-\)intercept of line \(n\) is \((0, 25)\).
                <br>
                Choice A is correct because it represents the new \(y-\)intercept after the line has been translated upwards by \(25\) dollars.

                Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because they do not accurately reflect the translation of the original line \(m\) by \(25\) dollars in the \(y-\)direction.

                Let's denote the number of miles traveled as \( m \). The total cost \( C \) of the trip is given by the flat fee plus the cost per mile multiplied by the number of miles:
                \[ C = 2.50 + 0.75m \]
                If the customer pays \($20.00\) for the trip, we set \( C \) to \(20\) and solve for \( m \):
                \[ 20 = 2.50 + 0.75m \]
                Subtracting the flat fee from both sides gives:
                \[ 17.50 = 0.75m \]
                Dividing both sides by \(0.75\) to find \( m \):

                To solve the system of equations for \(xy\), we need to find the values of \(x\) and \(y\). We can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, the elimination method is more straightforward:
                <br>
                Multiply the second equation by \(2\) to align the \(x\) terms:
                <br>

                \( (20x + 14y) - (5x + 14y) = 54 - 45 \)

                To determine the maximum number of units that can be produced while keeping the cost under \($800\), we can set up the inequality:
                \[ 5x + 300 < 800 \]
                Subtracting \($300\) from both sides of the inequality gives:
                \[ 5x < 500 \]
                Dividing both sides by \(5\) gives:
                \[ x < 100 \]
                Since \( x \) must be a whole number, the maximum number of units that can be produced is \(100\ \text{units}\).
                <br>
                Therefore, the correct answer is B, \( 100 \) units.
                <br>
                Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because they represent unit quantities that do not maximize the production capacity while staying under the cost threshold of \($800\).

                The average score of two tests is calculated by adding the scores of both tests and then dividing by \(2\). The equation to find the average is:
                \[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Score of Test 1} + \text{Score of Test 2}}{2} \]
                We are given the average score (\(90\) points) and the score of the first test (\(85\) points). Let \( x \) represent the score of the second test. Plugging the given values into the equation, we get:
                \[ 90 = \frac{85 + x}{2} \]
                Multiplying both sides by \(2\) to solve for \( x \):
                \[ 180 = 85 + x \]
                Subtracting \(85\) from both sides gives us:
                \[ x = 180 - 85 \]
                \[ x = 95 \]
                Therefore, the student scored \( 95 \) points on the second test, which corresponds to choice A.

                The \(y-\)intercept of line \(r\) is the profit when the quantity sold (\(x\)) is \(0\). From the table, we can see that the relationship is linear and directly proportional since doubling the quantity doubles the profit, and so on. This implies that at \(x = 0\), the profit (\(y\)) would also be \(0\). <br>
                When line \(r\) is moved downwards by \(50\) dollars to create line \(s\), the \(y-\)intercept is also moved down by \(50\) dollars. <br>
                Therefore, the \(y-\)intercept of line \(s\) is \(50\) dollars less than the \(y-\)intercept of line \(r\), making it \(0 - 50 = -50\). <br>
                So, the profit at the \(y-\)intercept of line \(s\) is \(-\$50\), corresponding to choice D.

                The correct answer is A. Given the function \(g(x) = m(x - 2) + 3\), we're told that the graph of \(g\) is a linear function that passes through the point \((2, 3)\) with a slope of \(1\). This information is about the function \(g(x)\).
                <br>
                Now, we're also told that the function \(m(x)\) is created by shifting the graph of \(g(x)\) down by \(5\) units. When a graph is shifted vertically, the shift affects the \(y-\)intercept of the function.
                <br>
                Since \(g(x)\) passes through \((2, 3)\), the point \((2, 3)\) satisfies the equation of \(g(x)\). This means:
                <br>
                \(g(2) = m(2 - 2) + 3\)
                <br>
                \(g(2) = m(0) + 3\)
                <br>
                \(3 = m(0) + 3\)
                <br>
                From this, we can see that \(m(0)\) must be \(0\), which fits our understanding since \(g(x)\) has not been shifted vertically.
                <br>
                To find the new function \(m(x)\) after shifting \(g(x)\) down by \(5\) units, we subtract \(5\) from the \(g(x)\) function. Thus, for any value of \(x\):
                <br>
                \(m(x) = g(x) - 5\), which matches option A.
                <br>
                Choice B is incorrect because adding \(2\) would shift the graph upwards, not downwards.
                <br>
                Choice C is incorrect for the same reason as B, and adding \(3\) would result in an even higher shift.
                <br>
                Choice D is incorrect because subtracting \(3\) would not account for the full downward shift observed in the graph.

                The correct answer is B. Perpendicular lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals of each other. 
                The slope of the first equation, \(3p + 4q = 8\), can be found by rewriting it in slope-intercept form \(y = mx + b\), 
                which gives us \(y = -\frac{3}{4}x + 2\). 
                Therefore, the slope is \(-\frac{3}{4}\). The slope of the second equation in option B is \(\frac{4}{3}\), which is the negative 
                reciprocal of \(-\frac{3}{4}\).
                <br>
                Options A and D are incorrect because the slopes of the second equations are not negative reciprocals of the first equation's slope. <br>
                Option C is incorrect because the slope of the second equation is \(3\), which is the not the reciprocal \(-\frac{3}{4}\), so the lines described by these equations would not be perpendicular.

                To find the range of values for \( x + 2 \), we first solve the given equation:
                \[ \frac{2x + 5}{6} = \frac{2x - 1}{12} \]
                Cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions:
                \[ 12(2x + 5) = 6(2x - 1) \]
                \[ 24x + 60 = 12x - 6 \]
                Subtract \( 12x \) from both sides:
                \[ 12x + 60 = -6 \]
                Subtract \( 60 \) from both sides:
                \[ 12x = -66 \]
                Divide by \( 12 \) to solve for \( x \):

                \[ x = -5.5 \]
                Now, add \( 2 \) to find the value of \( x + 2 \):

                For a system of equations to have no solution, the lines represented by the equations must be parallel, which means they have the same slope but different \(y-\)intercepts. The slope-intercept form of an equation is \( y = mx + b \), where \( m \) is the slope. The slope of the first equation is \( -\frac{m}{3} \), and the slope of the second equation is \( -\frac{12}{m} \). For the lines to be parallel, these slopes must be equal and the \(y-\)intercepts must be different.
                <br>
                Setting the slopes equal to each other:

                However, if \( m = 6 \), the two equations would be identical (not parallel) since substituting \( m \) into the second equation would give \( 12x + 6y = 6 \), which simplifies to the first equation when divided by \(2\). <br> 
                Therefore, the value of \( m \) that results in no solution is \( m = -6 \), which makes the lines parallel with different \(y-\)intercepts.

                To find the cost of the same order at the second shop, we calculate the price for \(8\) small coffees and \(5\) large coffees with the prices from the second shop:
                <br>
                \( 8 \times $1.50 \) for small coffees \( + \) \( 5 \times $2.75 \) for large coffees.

                The equation \(5s + 20l = 25,000\) relates the number of students in small schools (\(s\)) and large schools (\(l\)) to the total student population. Given that \(l\) represents the number of large schools, and there are \(20\) large schools, \(20l\) is the total number of students across all large schools. Therefore, \(5s\) must represent the total number of students across all small schools, not the average number.
                <br>
                Choice A is incorrect because \(s\) is multiplied by \(5\), which is the number of small schools, indicating a total rather than an average.

                To determine the slope of the line that represents the relationship between \(x\) and \(y\), we can calculate the change in \(y\) over the change in \(x\) between any two points. Using the first and second points:

                For the system to not have exactly one solution, it must either have no solutions or infinitely many solutions. This happens when the two equations are proportional, leading to parallel lines (no solutions) or the same line (infinitely many solutions). To check for proportionality, the coefficients of \(x\) and \(y\) in the two equations are compared.
                <br>
                In the first equation, the coefficient of \(x\) is \(q\) and of \(y\) is \(-5\). <br> 
                In the second equation, the coefficients are \(15\) and \(q\) respectively. <br> 
                For the lines to be parallel, the ratios of the coefficients must be equal, which implies \(q/15 = -5/q\). Solving this, \(q^2 = -75\), giving \(q = \pm\sqrt{75}\).
                <br>
                Since \(-\sqrt{75}\) is a potential solution to this equation, it could be the value of \(q\) that makes the lines parallel. However, since we are looking for what \(q\) is not, the answer is E because it's given as a negative square root, indicating that it is indeed not the value for \(q\) that would result in one unique solution.
                <br>
                Therefore, the correct answer is E, \(-\sqrt{75}\), as it is the value of \(q\) that does not lead to exactly one solution for the system of equations.

                To find the interval for \( k + 3 \), we start by solving the given equation for \( k \):
                \[ \frac{3k-8}{9} = \frac{3k+16}{18} \]
                Multiplying both sides by \(18\) to eliminate the denominators gives us:
                \[ 2(3k-8) = 3k+16 \]
                Expanding and simplifying:
                \[ 6k - 16 = 3k + 16 \]
                \[ 3k = 32 \]
                \[ k = \frac{32}{3} \]
                Adding \(3\) to \( k \):
                \[ k + 3 = \frac{32}{3} + \frac{9}{3} \]
                \[ k + 3 = \frac{41}{3} \]
                The interval for \( k + 3 \) is a single value, \( \frac{41}{3} \), which is approximately \( 13.67 \), the range that contains \( 13.67 \) is from \(7\) and \(15\), making option B the correct choice.

                To find the correct values of \(m\) and \(n\) for the lines to be perpendicular, we set the slopes of the two lines equal to negative reciprocals of each other. Since the slope of the first equation is \(\frac{4}{3}\), the slope of the second equation must be \(-\frac{3}{4}\) for them to be perpendicular. This means \(m\) must be \(\frac{4}{3}\) when \(n\) is \(1\).<br>

                Option D satisfies the condition because \(m = \frac{4}{3}\) and \(n = 1\) are the correct values for the lines to be perpendicular.

                The equation \(3o + 15r = 45,000\) indicates that \(o\) multiplied by \(3\) plus \(r\) multiplied by \(15\) equals the total floor space of \(45,000\) square meters. Since \(o\) is multiplied by \(3\), the number of office buildings, it represents the total floor space of each office building combined, not the average.<br>
                Choice A is incorrect because \(o\) represents the total, not the average.<br>
                Choice B is incorrect because \(r\) represents the retail stores, not \(o\).<br>
                Choice C is correct because multiplying the total floor space of each office building by the number of office buildings \((3)\) gives the total floor space for all office buildings.<br>
                Choice D is incorrect because it concerns the retail stores, not the office buildings.

                Since the line passes through the point \((-3, -1)\), we can substitute these values into the function \(q(x)\) to find \(c\). 
                <br>
                \(-1 = -\frac{1}{3}(-3) + c\)

                \(c = -2\)
                <br>
                Therefore, the equation of the line is \(q(x) = -\frac{1}{3}x - 2\), which corresponds to option C.
                <br>
                Options A, B, and D are incorrect because substituting \(-3\) for \(x\) does not result in a \(y-\)value of \(-1\).

                The value of a blue sticker is \(3\) points and the value of a yellow sticker is \(7\) points. The difference in their values is \( 7 - 3 = 4 \). Therefore, a yellow sticker is worth \(4\) more points than a blue sticker.

                This can be calculated simply by comparing the point values assigned to each sticker color.
